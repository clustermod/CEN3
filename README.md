**CE:N** is an effort by the **Cluster Community Mod Team** to enhance the individual experience by our playerbase.

This addon is entirely open source and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License ([GPLv3](https://github.com/Clustermod/CEN3/blob/master/LICENSE)).

An attempt has been made to build the addon modularly so almost any *module* can easily be removed from the configuration. This way, a team can maintain it's own tailored version of **CEN3** by simply excluding any components they don't need. The entire framework has been built with customization in mind allowing mission designers to tweak it to suit their needs.

## What is CE:N?
**CE:N** is an Arma 3 addon that adds a notepad system to arma 3 with unique notepads that can be looted and read. In addition it adds the ability to add index cards like 9-lines, Call-for-Fire, Range cards etc. and is extremly customizeable. It aims to get as close to a real life notepad as it can and is even affected by light levels.

## Contributing
You can help out with the ongoing development by looking for potential bugs in the framework, or by contributing new features. We are always welcoming new pull requests containing bug fixes, refactors and new features.
